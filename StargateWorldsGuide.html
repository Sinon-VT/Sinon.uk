<span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><font size="+1">This guide is here as a quick reference to aid you in playing Stargate Worlds.<br>As
you probably&nbsp;know, Stargate Worlds is an online MMORPG which
ceased development in 2009 and was never officially released. &nbsp;The
game was largely unfinished, but it did go through some alpha and beta
testing before being abandoned.<br><br>Recently,
a team of volunteer developers released a server emulator, allowing
anyone to host their own Stargate Worlds server. &nbsp;You can set it
up on your own computer and use it to play privately, or set it up for
remote access and play with others. &nbsp;You can also connect to
servers that others have made publically available.<br><br>While
exploring the maps, you'll&nbsp; find that they are truely amazing in
size and detail, but unfortunately, the game was far from finished, and
lots of things are missing or not working properly. &nbsp;Aside from
actually walking around the maps and interacting with a few
things,&nbsp;most everything else is currently done via console
commands.<br><br>Below is a guide
to using console commands to do things like enabling stargate travel,
equipping weapons and other items, and more. &nbsp;The list will grow over time as i discover
more and as my free time allows.<br><br></font></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><font size="+1">Please visit <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 255);" href="http://stargateresistance.us/forum/stargate-worlds/" target="_blank">Project Giza</a></font></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><font size="+1">

detailed instructions on installing and configuring the SGW client and
server software.<br></font></span><br><br><table style="width: 90%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span><br><big><font size="+1"><big><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></big></font></big><br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></div><table style="width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">When
you first create a character and start to play, you'll find that there
are a few storyline objectives that you can complete. &nbsp;But you'll
quickly run out of things to do. &nbsp;At this point, you're stuck in
one map with nothing to do and no way out. &nbsp;Now you'll need
to use console commands to unlock the rest of what SGW has to offer. <br><br>In
SGW, there is no hidden command console like you find in many games.
&nbsp;Instead, you enter the commands right into the chat
window. &nbsp;All commands must be preceeded by a period(.) or a
forward slash(/), depending on the command. &nbsp;The syntax must be
exactly correct for the commands to work.<br><br>Some
commands require that your character is selected. &nbsp;Click on your
character to select it. &nbsp;Yellow lines will appear around your
character, and a second character status icon will appear at the top of
the screen. &nbsp;Sometimes the icon will still be there even though
your character is not selected anymore, so just click somewhere else
then on your character again.<br><br>Console commamds are in <span style="color: white;">white</span> text<br><br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><big style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">Ghosting</big><br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">Ghosting
allows you to move in any direction and pass through solid objects.
&nbsp;Want to see what's behind that door that won't open? &nbsp;Just activate
ghost mode and fly right through it. &nbsp;Use the following commands to
turn ghost mode on and off.<br><br><span style="color: white;">/gmsetghost on</span><br style="color: white;"><span style="color: white;">/gmsetghost off</span><br><br><br><big style="color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flying</span></big><br></span></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><br>Flying is similar to ghosting, except that you can't pass through solid objects.<br><br><span style="color: white;">/gmsetfly on</span><br style="color: white;"><span style="color: white;">/gmsetfly off</span><br><br><br><big style="color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Speed</span></big><br><br>You
can change how fast your character moves around the map. &nbsp;This is
very useful when using ghost or fly mode, but you may also want to move
a bit faster on the ground since there is no way to sprint.
&nbsp;Normal speed is 100, and i find that 150 is a good ground speed,
and 200-300 is good for flying/ghosting.<br><br><span style="color: white;">.speed 200</span><br><br><br><big style="color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changing maps</span></big><br><br>Traveling
to other worlds can of course be done by walking through the stargate,
but i'll cover that later. &nbsp;You can also change maps with a
console </span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">command </span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">by entering the command followed by the map name, and then the coordinates of the exact location you want to transport to.<br>Below are a few examples, but the full list of available planets and coordinates can be found <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 255);" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgUVRYBDl8IddC1QNEJSa1l2VnJEdnhFa1paSnJ1NWc&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">HERE</a>.<br>Note
that only the aquired maps (indicated in the left column) are
available. &nbsp;Trying to transport to a map that doesn't exist will
disconnect you from the server.<br><br><span style="color: white;">.gotolocation SGC 174 -6 8</span><br style="color: white;"></span><span style="color: white;">.gotolocation Dakara_E1 98 -13 255</span><br style="color: white;"><span style="color: white;">.gotolocation Harset 2 -65 40</span><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><br>Note:
&nbsp;When you arrive in a new map, you may sometimes find yourself stuck and
unable to move. &nbsp;When that happens, just activate ghost mode and
move to a safe location, free of obstructions, then turn off ghost mode.<br><br><br><big style="color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teleporting within the same map</span></big><br><br>Similar
to the gotolocation command, the gotoxyz command will allow you to
instantly teleport to a different location within the same map.<br>For
example, if you are in the city on Agnos, and you want to teleport to
the Plasma Pumping Station, you would enter the following command.<br><br><span style="color: white;">.gotoxyz -480 4 -730</span><br><br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">Using the Stargates</big><br><br>To
use the stargates, you must first aquire stargate addresses. &nbsp;Each
stargate has a unique ID number, and you can give yourself stargate
addresses by entering the proper command while your character is
selected. &nbsp;You can also give addresses to other players by
selecting them and then entering the command.<br><br>Here is a list of all the available stargate ID numbers:<br>25,3,10,23,2,20,8,7,5,17,27<br><br>There
are two agruements required for this command. &nbsp;First is the ID,
and then you need to specify if it is hidden or not. &nbsp;Of course
you don't want it hidden, so the arguement would be 0 (no), as opposed
to 1 (yes).<br>So to give yourself the address to Dakara, select your character, then enter the following command:<br><br><span style="color: white;">.giveaddress 25 0</span><br><br>You can only enter one address per command, so you will have to enter the command a number of times to aquire all the addresses.<br>To
make this a little less tedious, you can recall previous commands by
selecting the chat field and pressing the up arrow key. &nbsp;The last
command you typed will appear. &nbsp;Then you just need to change the
ID number and hit enter.<br><br>After you have some stargate addresses,
you will now be able to use the stargates. &nbsp;To bring up the DHD
control, select your character and use the following command:<br><br><span style="color: white;">.net_dhd</span><br><br>If
you click on the name of the planet, the gate will auto-dial and
activate. &nbsp;If you prefer to dial the gate manually, click the box
to the left of the planet name.<br><br>Note:
There is a fix that will allow you to simply interact with the DHD to
activate it, without needing to use a console command, and it will be
implemented soon.<br><br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><big style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">Goto / Summon</big></span><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"><br>You
